		  <p>My junior year, 2013 team, we finished 38-10-1, the best record in school history. In the middle of the year we went on a 15 game winning streak. This image is the start of our double header against GW. After sweeping them, we clinched the regular season title.</p>

		  <h2>Jake Race</h2>

		  <p>Every year our team participates in a 5K run, started by our assistant coach's family after her older brother died of Lukemia. Every year hundreds come to support and run the race and every year one sponsor child is chosen. All the money raised from the race goes to him/her. This is our 2012 race.</p>

		 <p>Amherst, Massachussetts, May 11, 2013-- Fordham went into the Championship game as the top seed. We had to beat them twice to claim the title.</p> 
		 <p>We took game 1 with ease, 7-1. Game 2 Fordham was winning 6-0 for the first 6 innings. We battled back in the 7th, scoring 5 runs.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately we fell short and watched the trophy go to Fordham. This was our 3rd time in 5 years taking 2nd.</p>
